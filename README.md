A small project in free time. A smart car is mounted with Sunfounder components/modules. 
The code is simpler than the one of Sunfounder.
Moreover, the OpenCV library is used for face detection through the camera attached to the raspberry.
A Django server is hosted to show the video and send commands to the car.
